# Write-ups

This folder contains some write-ups of challenges we solved during LA CTF 2023.

## Introduction

Before getting into the write-ups, let's give some background information: we're a team of 3 students at Eindhoven University of Technology.
We're in a university track for competitive programming, were we have some experience in algorithmic programming.
However, we did not have any experience in CTFs, and this was the first one we participated in.

Some of us have some background with cryptography, mostly through university courses. We also practiced some things in the weeks before the CTF started, but not as much as we would have wanted. We did not practice `pwn` or `rev` challenges, as we thought that, with the limited time we had, these would be too challenging to prepare. However, despite this we managed to solve 4/8 `rev` challenges during the CTF, and one `pwn` challenge. 

Although `web` was the category we prepared most, we only managed to get 2/9 challenges during the competition.
We suspect the cause of this was either that we lost some motivation for the category after spending way too much time on `web/metaverse`, because we missed the part of the code that said the flag was in the display name of the admin user.
Another possible explanation is that the web category was more difficult than some of the other categories in this CTF:

Despite this, we we're very satisfied with [our overall result](../README.md).
