# File_size_matter_not

### Description
Aye, aye captain! One of our rebel spaceships has retrieved a destroyed satellite and was able to recover its hard drive. 
The Jedi researchers say that the data is scrambled in some parts. May the force be with you as you try to decode it!

File given: hard_drive

Category: forensics. 495 points. 29 solves

## Solution

### Analysis
We can see that the given file has no extension nor it can be executed, so `binwalk` is the way to go. The Linux tool can display and extract embedded data from the given file. Using the command `binwalk -e` gave the following outputs:

``
$ binwalk -e hard_drive

Inside the extracted folder, we found an encrypted zip file containing folder `.deleted_files` with 4 more hidden files. The password can be found in the binwalk analysis (also metadata) `baby_but_strong`.

### The 'sus' gif
After all the extractions, we were left with these following 4 files, in which one can be opened as a `gif`.
*cd to path ./_hard_drive.extracted/.deleted_files if you can't seem to find those files anywhere*

![four files](<_deleted_files.png>)

However, the gif is a little sus à¶ž 

More precisely, the stream of images ended too early, causing the gif to appear discontinuous, or laggy. Combining this element with the hint from the challenge description *the data is scrambled in some parts*, we can suspect that some parts of the gif file were missing. To further confirm this suspicion, we analyze all 4 files in a hex editor and saw that files 12, 212, and 455 don't have 'normal headers'. By that we mean the typical file header signature(s) following with empty spaces as shown in the comparison below:

![normal header](<normal_header.png>)
![no header](<no_header.png>)

Thus the next step would be to concatenate all the parts to make a complete gif file.

### Concatenation

We concatenated the files by manually copying & pasting from one file to another, which could have been done more efficiently by using the `cat` command: `cat file1 file2 > file3.gif`.

After getting the complete gif (`cat 45 12 212 455 > flag.gif`), we extract images of the gif to read all characters of the flag using the `ffmpeg` tool: `ffmpeg -i flag.gif out%d.png`.

![baby yoda](<flag.gif>)

Finally, we get the flag `shctf{sm4LL_but_m1gh7y}`.

## Reflection

Opening file 45 with Image Viewer on Linux didn't clearly show that the gif file was missing some parts, but rather just a normal gif. That delayed our progress significantly and we only managed to confirm our suspicion after a teammember opened the file with a different application, which showed the lagginess of the gif.
