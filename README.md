# CTFs
Collection of CTFs we've participated in

Contains things like code used, challenge files and write-ups. Also some screenshots of the results. 

For each CTF, create a directory with the name and year of the CTF (if this is not a superkey to *all* CTFs, add more data, such as the month or full date).
